# Speech_to_Text
This code converts speech to text using the vosk API. Input can either be from the microphone or media. Outputs can be written into a file for easy view and use. The python packages required to run the code succesfully can be found in the requirements.txt file. There are two sample files included for testing. Both require the use of the test_ffmpeg.py file included in the vosk API file because they are not mono wav files. Mono wav files use the test_simple.py file.
